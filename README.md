# Web-Scraping
Marcus's Assignment 12

The objective of this assignment was to extract specific items from an CNN Mars article. 
There were two deliverable items. Part one consisted of scraping titles and preview text from Mars articles. Part two consited of scraping and analyze Mars weather data. Web scraping was a struggle for me.
